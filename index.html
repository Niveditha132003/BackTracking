    <h1 class="a1">Backtracking</h1>
    <!--Inline css-->
    <p  class="a2">Backtracking is a form of recursion.<br>
    The usual senario is that you are faced with a number of options,nd you must choose one of these.After you make your
    choice you will get a new set of options ,just what set of options you get depends on what choice you made.This procedure is
    repeated over and over until you reach a final state .If you made good sequence of choices,your final state is a goal state,if
    you didn't,it isn't <br><br>
    Conceptually,you start at the root of the tree ,the tree probably has some good leavesand bad leaves,though it may be that
    the leaves are all good or all bad. You want to get  to a good leaf.At each node,beginning with the root ,you choose one of its
    children to move to,and you kee[ this up until you get a leaf.<br><br>
    Suppose you get to a bad leaf .You can backtrack to continue the search for a good leaf revoking your most recent choice.
    and trying out the next option in the set of options .If you run out of options,revoke the choice that you here,and try
    another choice at the node If you end up at the root with no options left,there are no good leaves to be found 
<br>This needs a example</p>

    </ol>
    <h2 class="a24">Non-recursive backtracking,using a stack</h2>

    <p class="a25">Backtracking is rather typical recursive algorithm,and any recursive algorithm can be rewritten as a stack algorithm.In fact,
        that is how your recursive algorithms are translated into machine or assembly language
    </p>
    <div class="a26"><pre class="a27">
        boolean solve(Node n)
        put node n on the stack
        while the stack is not empty{
            if the node at the top of the stack is a leaf{
                if it is a goal node,return true
                else pop it off the stack
            }
            else{
                if the node at the top of the stack has untried children
                push the next untried child onto the stack
                else pop the node off the stack
            }
            return false
        }
        
    </pre></div>
    <p class="a28"><br><br>Starting from the root,the only nodes that can be pushed onto the stack are the children of the node currently on the top of the stack,
        and these are only pushed on one child at a time;hence,the nodes on the stack at all times describe a valid path in the tree.
        Nodes are removed from the stack only when it is known that they have no goal nodes among their descendents.Therefore,
        if the root node gets removed(making the stack empty),there must have been no goal nodes at all,and no solution to the problem.<br><br>
        When the stack algorithm terminates successfully,the nodes on the stack form(in reverse order) a path from the root to a goal Node<br><br>
        Similarly,when the recursive algorithm finds a goal node,the path information is emboided (in reverse order) in the sequence of
        recursive calls.Thus as the unwinds,the path can be recovered one node at a time ,by (for inatance) printing the Node
        at the current level,or storing it in an array.
    <br>Here is the recursive backtracking algorithm,modified slightly to print (in reverse order) the nodes along the successful path:</p>
<div class="a29"><pre class="a30">
    boolean solve(Node n){
        if n is a leaf node{
            if the leaf is a goal node{
                 print n
                 return true
            }
            else return false
        }else{
            for each child c of n{
                if solve(c) succeeds{
                    print n 
                return true
                }
            }
            return false
        }
        }
</pre></div>
<br>
<h2 class="a31">Keeping backtracking simple</h2>
<p class="a32"><br>All of these versions of the backtracking algorithm are pretty simple,but when applied to a real problem,they can get pretty
    cluttered up with details.Even determining whether the node is a leaf can be complex.<br><br>

    for example,if the path represents a series of moves ina chess endgame problem, the leaves are the checkmate and statements
    solutions.<br><br>

    To keep the program clean,therefore,tests like this should be buried in methods.IN chess game,for example,you could test
    whether a node is a leaf by writing a <strong class="b">gameOver method</strong>(or yopu could even call it <strong class="b">isLeaf).</strong>This method would encapsulate all 
    the ugly details of figuring out whether any possible moves remain
<br><br>

    Notice that the backtracking algorithms require us to keep track,for each node on the current path,which of its children have
    been tried already(so we don,t have to try them again).In the above code we made this look simple,by just saying <strong class="b">for each child
    c of n.</strong>In reality, it may be difficult to figure out what the possible children are, and there may be no obvious way to step throughly
    them.In chess,for example,a node can represent one arrangement of pecies on a chessboard, and each child of that node can represent
    the arrangement after some piece has made a legal move.How do you find these children, and how do you keep track
    of which ones you,ve already examined?
<br><br>
    The most straightforward way to keep track of which children of the node have been is as follows:Upon initial entry to 
    the node (that is,when you first get there from above),make a list of all its children.As you try each child,take it off 
    the list.When the list is empty,there are no remaining untried children, and you can return "failure".This is asimple approach,but it may require
    quite a lot of additional work
<br><br>
    There is an easier way to keep track of which children have been tried,if you can  define an ordering on the children.If there is an
    ordering,and you know which child you just tried,you can dertermine which child to try next.
<br><br>
    For example, you might be able to number the <strong class="b">children 1 through n,</strong> and try them in numerical order.Then ,if you have just tried
    <strong class="b">child k,</strong>you know that you have already tried children 1 through <strong class="b">k-1,</strong>and you have not yet tried children<strong>k+1</strong>through<strong>n.</strong>Or,if you
    are trying to color a map with just four colors,you can always try <strong class="b">red first,then yellow,then green,then blue.</strong>if child yellow fails,
    you know to try child green next.If you are searching a maze, you can try choices in the order left,straight,right<strong class="b"> (or perhaps
        north,east,south,west).
    </strong>
<br><br>

    It isn't always easy to find a simple way to order the children of a node <strong class="b">In the chess game example,</strong>you might number your
    pieces (or perhaps the squares of the board) and try in numerical order,but in addition each piece may also have several 
    moves,and these must also be ordered.
</p>
<h2 class="a33">Example: Tree Search</h2>
<p class="a34">
    For starters,let's do the simplest possible example of backtracking, which is searching an actual tree.We will also use
     the simplest kind of tree, a binary tree.
<br>

    A binary tree is a data structure composed of nodes.One node is designated as root node.Each node can reference(point
    to) zero,one,or two other nodes,which are called its children.The children are reffered to as the left child and /or the right child
    All nodes are reachable (by one or more steps) from the root node,and there are no cycles.For our purposes,although this is not 
    part of the defination of a binary tree,we will say that a node might or might not be a goal node, and will contain its 
    The first example in this paper(which we repeat here)shows a binary tree.<br>


    Here's a defination of the binary Tree class:
</p>
<div class="a35"><pre class="a36">
    public class Binary Tree{
        BinaryTree leftchild=null;
        BinaryTree rightchild=null;
        boolean isGoalNode=false;
        String name;
        <br>
    BinaryTree(String name,BinaryTree left,BinaryTree right,boolean isGoalNode){
        this name=name;
        leftChild=left;
        rightChild=right;
        this isGoalNode=isGoalNode
    }
  }
</pre></div>
<p class="a37">Next we will create a TreeSearch class and in it we will define a method makeTree() which constructs the above binary tree</p>
<div class="a38"><pre class="a39">
    static BinaryTree makeTree(){
        BinaryTree root,a,b,c,d,e,f;
        c=new BinaryTree("C",null,null,false);
        d=new BinaryTree("D",null,null,false);
        e=new BinaryTree("E",null,null,true);
        f=new BinaryTree("F",null,null,false);
        a=new BinaryTree("A",c,d,false);
        root=newBinaryTree("Root",a,b,false);
        return root;
    }
</pre></div>
<p class="a40">Here's a main program to create a binary tree and try to solve it</p>
<div class="a41"><pre class="a42">
    public static void main(String args[]){
        BinaryTree tree=makeTree[];
        System.out.printin(solvable(tree));
    }
</pre></div>
<p class="a43">And finally,here's the recursive backtracing routine to "solve" the binary tree by finding a goal node</p>
<div class="a44"><pre class="a45">
    static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node){
    /* 1 */ if (node==null) return false;
    /* 2 */ if (node.isGoalNode) return true;
    /* 3 */ if (solvable(node.leftChild)) return true;
    /* 4 */ if (solvable(node.rightChild)) return true;
    /* 5 */ return false;
    }
</pre></div>
<p class="a46">Here's what numbered lines are doning</p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li class="n1">If we are given a null node,it's not solvable.This statement  is so that we can call this method with the children of node,withoutfirst checking whether those children actually exist.</li>
<li class="n2">If the node we are given is a goal node,return success</li>
<li class="n3">See if the left child of node is solvable, and if so, conclude that node is solvable.We will only get to thios line if node is non-null and is not a goal node,says to</li>
<li class="n4">Do the same thing for the right child.</li>
<li class="n5">Since neither child of node is solvable,node itself is not solvable</li>
</ol>
<p class="a47">This program runs correctly and produces the unenlightening result true</p>
<p class="a48">Each time we ask for another node,we have to check if it is null.In the above we put that check as the first thing in
    solvable.An alternative would be to check first whether each exists, and recur only if they do.Here's that alternative version.
</p>
<div class="a49"><pre class="a50" >
    static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node){
        if (node.isGoalNode) return node;
        if (node.leftChild!=null&&solvable(node.leftChild)) return true;
        if (node.rightChild!=null&&solvable(node.rightChild)) return true;
        return false;
        }
</pre></div>
<p class="a51">think the first version is simpler,but the second version is slightly more efficient</p>
<h3 class="a52">What are the children?</h3>
<p class="a53">One of the things that simplifies the above binary tree search is that,at each choice point,you can ignore all the previous
    choices.Previous choices don't give you any information about waht you should do next;as you know,both the left and 
    the right child are possible solutions.In many problems,however,you may be able to eliminate children immediately,without
    recursion.<br><br>
    Consider, for example ,the problem of four-coloring a map.It is a theorem of mathematics that any map on a plane, no matter
    how convolunated the countries are, can be colored with at most four colors, so that no two countries that share a border are 
    the same colour.
<br><br>
    To color a map, you choose a color for the first country ,then a color for the second country and so on,until all countries 
    are colored.
<br><br>There are two ways to do this<br></p>
<ul>
    <li class="a54">Method 1: Try each of the four possible colors, and recur.When you run out of countries,check whether you are  at a  goal node</li>
    <li class="a55">Method 2: Try only those colors that have not already been used for an adjacent country,and recur.If and when you run out of
        countries,you have successfully colored the map
    </li>
</ul>
<p class="a56">Let's apply each of these two methods to the problem of coloring a checkboard.This should be easily solvable,after all,
    a checkboard only needs two colors.</p>
    <div class="a57"><h3><bold style="color: black;">boolean maplsOK()</bold></h3>
    <p>Used by method 1 to check (at a leaf node) whether the entire map is colored correctly</p>
    <h3><bold style="color: black;">boolean okToColor(int row,int column,int color)</bold></h3>
    <p>Used by method 2 to check, at every node, whether there is an adjacent node already colored with the given color.</p>
    <h3><bold style="color: black;" >int [] nextRowAndColumn(int row,int column)</bold></h3>
    <p>Used by both methods to find the next "country" (actually,the row and column of the next square on the checkerboard)</p></div>
    <p class="a58">Here's the code for method 1:</p>
    <div class="a59"><pre class="a60">
        boolean explore1(int row,int column,int color){
            if(row>=NUM_ROWS)return maplsOK();
            map[row][column]=color;
            for(int nextColor=RED;nextColor<=BLUE;nextColor++){
                int[] next=nextRowAndColumn(row,column);
                if (explore1(next[0],next[1],nextColor)) return true;
            }
            return false;
        }
    </pre></div>
    <p class="a61">And here's the code for method 2:</p>
    <div class="a62"><pre class="a63">

    <p class="a66">The zeros in the above table indicate times too short to measure (less than 1 millisecond).
        Why this huge difference? Either of these methods could have exponential growth. Eliminating a node automatically 
        eliminates all of its descendents, and this will often prevent exponential growth. Conversely, by waiting to check 
        until a leaf node is reached, exponential growth is practically guaranteed. If there is any way to eliminate
         children (reduce the set of choices), do so!</p>
         <h2 class="a67">Debugging techniques</h2>
         <p class="a68">Often our first try at a program doesn't work, and we need to debug it. Debuggers are helpful, but sometimes 
            we need to fall back on inserting print statements. There are some simple tricks to making effective use of print statements. 
            These tricks can be applied to any program, but are especially useful when you are trying to debug recursive routines.</p>
            <div class="a69"><h2 class="a70">Trick #1: Indent when you print method entries and exits. </h2>
                <p class="a71">Often, the best debugging technique is to print every method call and return (or at least the most important ones).
                     You probably want to print, for each method, what parameters it came in with, and what value it leaves with.
                      However, if you just print a long list of these, it's hard to match up method exits with their corresponding entries.

            <h3 class="a83">Trick #3: Never discard your debugging statements.</h3>    
            <p class="a84">Writing debugging statements is programming, too. Often it's as much work to debug the debugging statements 
                as it is to debug the actual program. Once your program is working, why throw this code away?<br><br> Obviously, you don't want to print out all this
                 debugging information from a program you are ready to submit (or to turn over to your manager). You could comment out your debugging calls,
                  but that can be a lot of work. What's more, in the above example, you would have to replace every return(yes(node)) with return(true), and
                   every return(no(node)) with return false. With all these changes, you might introduce new bugs into your program.<br><br> The simple solution is
                    to make your debugging statements conditional. For example,</p>  
            <div class="a85"><pre class="a86">                   
                static final boolean debugging = false; 
                static void enter(BinaryTree node) { 
                    if (debugging) {
                 System.out.println(indent + "Entering solvable(" + name(node) + ")"); 
                 indent = indent + "| "; 
                }
                } <br>
             static boolean yes(BinaryTree node) { 
                if (debugging) 
                { indent = indent.substring(3);
                 System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") returns true"); 
                }
                 return true;
             }<br>
                  static boolean no(BinaryTree node) {
                 if (debugging) { indent = indent.substring(3);
                 System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") returns false"); 
                }
                 return false;
                 }
                 </pre></div>

        <p class="a87">In industry, actual programs often have multiple flags to control different aspects of debugging. Don't worry too much about making your code larger;
             modern compilers will notice that since the variable debugging is final, it can never be true, and the controlled code will be discarded.</p>
             <h3 class="a88">Trick #4: Create an Exception.</h3>
             <p class="a89">If an Exception is thrown, you can get information about just where it happened by sending it the message printStackTrace(PrintStream). 
                Since an Exception is an object like any other, you can create and throw your own Exceptions. However, Java programmers don't always realize that you 
                can create an Exception without throwing it. For example, the following code</p>
        <div class="a90"><pre class="a91"> new Exception("Checkpoint Charlie").printStackTrace(System.out);</pre></div><br>
        <p class="a92">will print out a message something like this, and the program will then continue normally. That is, the above code just acts like a print statement.

        </p> 
        <div class="a93"><pre class="a94">

                       The backtracking method is named solvable and returns a boolean. In solvable we shall need to check whether we are at a leaf, which in this case
                        means a position from which no further moves are possible. This isn't so easy.<br><br> Now to the program. The main program will
                         initialize the board, and call a recursive backtracking routine to attempt to solve the puzzle. The backtracking routine will 
                         either succeed and print out a winning path, or it will fail, and the main program will have to print out the bad news.<br><br>
                          The backtracking method is named solvable and returns a boolean. In solvable we shall need to check whether we are at
                           a leaf, which in this case means a position from which no further moves are possible. This isn't so easy.<br><br> Each possible move 
                           will result in a new board position, and these new board positions are the children of the current board position. Hence to
                            find the children of a node (that is, of a board position), we need only find the possible moves from that node.
                             Remember that it is also highly desirable to find an ordering on these possible moves.<br><br> Here it is time to stop
                              and take thought. To make progress, we must analyze the game to some extent. Probably a number of approaches
                               would work, and what follows is based on the way I worked it out. If you were to program this puzzle, you might 
                               find a different but equally valid approach.<br><br> First, notice that if a marble has a move, that move is unique: if it 
                               can move ahead one square, then it cannot jump. If it can jump, it cannot move ahead one square. This suggests that,
                                to find the possible moves, we might assign numbers to the marbles, and check each marble in turn. When we have looked
                                 at all the marbles, we have looked at all the possible moves. This would require having a table to keep track of where each 
                                 marble is, or else somehow "marking" each marble with its number and searching the board each time to find the marble we want
                                 . Neither alternative is very attractive.<br><br> Next, notice that for a given board position, each marble occupies a 
                                 unique space. Hence, instead of talking about moving a particular marble, we can talk about moving the marble in a 
                                 particular space. If a move is possible from a given space, then that must be the only move possible from that space,
                                  because if the marble in that space has a move, it is unique. There is a slight complication because not every space 
                            contains a marble, but at least the spaces (unlike the marbles) stay in one place.
                    </p>
                    <p class="c6">Now we have a simpler ordering of moves to use in our program. Just check, in order, the 2n+1 spaces of the board. For each space, 
                        either zero or one moves is possible. With this understanding, we can write a boolean method canMove(int[] board, int position)
                         which determines whether a move is possible from the given position:</p>
                         <ul>
                            <li class="c7">If the position is empty, no move is possible;</li>
                            <li class="c8">If the position contains a black marble, the method checks for a move or jump to the right;</li>
                            <li class="c9">If the position contains a white marble, the method checks for a move or jump to the left.</li>
                         </ul>
                         <p class="c10">We write another method <strong style="color:black">int[] makeMove(int[] oldBoard, int position)</strong> that will take a board and a position,
                             make a move from that position, and return as its value a new board. (We could write this somewhat more
                              efficiently by changing the old board, rather than creating a new one, but here we are more concerned with simplicity.)
                               In technical jargon, makeMove is "applicative" rather than "mutative.<br><br>" Along with <strong style="color:black">canMove and makeMove,</strong>we are using
                                methods <strong style="color: black;">puzzleSolved and printBoard</strong> with meanings that should be obvious. With these methods, our central backtracking
                                 method can be written as follows:</p>
                                 <div class="d1">
                                    <pre class="d2">
        boolean solvable(int[] board) { 
         if (puzzleSolved(board)) { 
        return true; 
        } 
        for (int position = 0; position < BOARD_SIZE; position++) {
        if (canMove(board, position)) { 
        int[] newBoard = makeMove(board, position); 
        if (solvable(newBoard)) { printBoard(newBoard);
        return true;
        }
        }
      } 
     return false;
    }
                                    </pre>
                                 </div>

                    <p class="d8">
                        Notice that the solution is given in reverse order: BLACK starts out on the left and WHITE on the right, as 
                        in the last line. I've added line numbers to the actual output in order to emphasize this point. 
                        Backtracking always produces its results (sequence of choices) in reverse order; it is up to you, the 
                        programmer, to reverse the results again to get them in the correct order.
